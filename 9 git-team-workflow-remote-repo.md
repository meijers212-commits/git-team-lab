# Lab: Git Team Workflow with Remote Repositories

**Duration:** 90–120 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Basic terminal navigation, text editor familiarity  
---

## Overview

This lab teaches you how to work like a professional software team using Git with a remote repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). You'll learn to initialize a local repository, connect it to a remote server, verify everything works at each step, and execute a realistic branching/merging workflow used in production environments.  
**Key Learning Outcomes:**

- Understand the relationship between local and remote repositories  
- Master upstream tracking and branch management  
- Execute a professional branching strategy (main/dev/feature/\*)  
- Debug common push/pull failures  
- Verify system correctness at every stage

---

## Part 0: Mental Model & Pre-Check

### Understanding the Git Architecture

Before diving into commands, you need to understand the three-layer system you're working with:

#### **1\. Local Repository (.git directory)**

- Lives on your machine in the `.git` folder  
- Contains all commits, branches, staging area, and history  
- Completely independent—works offline  
- Your "source of truth" until you push

#### **2\. Remote Repository (server copy)**

- Lives on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket servers  
- Acts as the team's shared source of truth  
- Receives pushes, serves pulls  
- Does NOT automatically sync with your local repo

#### **3\. Remote Name "origin"**

- A nickname for the remote repository URL  
- Convention: the primary remote is called "origin"  
- You can have multiple remotes (e.g., "upstream", "fork")  
- Just a pointer—changing the name doesn't change the server

#### **4\. Upstream Tracking**

- A link between a local branch and a remote branch  
- Example: local `main` tracks `origin/main`  
- Enables simple `git push` and `git pull` without specifying destination  
- **Critical:** Without tracking, Git doesn't know where to push

**Mental Model Summary:**  
Your Computer                    Remote Server  
┌─────────────────┐             ┌──────────────┐  
│ Local Repo      		│             │ Remote Repo	      │  
│ (.git folder)   			│   push →  │ (GitHub)	      │  
│                                  	│   ← pull    │			      │  
│         main branch ────┼─tracking──→ 	      │ origin/main   │  
└─────────────────┘             └──────────────┘

### Pre-Check: Verify Your Environment

Run these commands to ensure you're ready:  
git \--version  
**Expected output:** `git version 2.x.x` or higher  
pwd  
**Expected output:** Your current directory path (you should know where you are)  
ls  
**Expected output:** Contents of current directory (verify you can list files)  
**If any command fails:** Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) or consult your system administrator.  
---

## Part 1: Create Project Folder & Initialize Local Repository

### Step 1.1: Create Project Folder

**Commands:**  
mkdir git-team-lab  
cd git-team-lab  
**What it does:**

- `mkdir git-team-lab`: Creates a new directory named "git-team-lab"  
- `cd git-team-lab`: Changes your current directory into the new folder

**Why it's needed:**

- Git repositories are folder-based; you need a dedicated project folder  
- Keeps your work organized and isolated from other projects

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- You'll initialize Git in the wrong directory (potentially your home folder)  
- Risk mixing project files with system files

**Verification:**  
pwd  
**What to look for:**

- Output should end with `/git-team-lab`  
- Example: `/Users/yourname/git-team-lab` or `/home/yourname/git-team-lab`

ls \-a  
**What to look for:**

- Should show only `.` and `..` (empty directory)  
- No `.git` folder yet (we haven't initialized Git)

---

### Step 1.2: Initialize Git Repository

**Command:**  
git init  
**What it does:**

- Creates a hidden `.git` directory in the current folder  
- Initializes the Git database (object store, refs, config)  
- Makes this folder a Git repository

**Why it's needed:**

- Without `.git`, Git commands won't work (Git won't recognize this as a repo)  
- The `.git` folder stores all commits, branches, staging area, and configuration

**What's inside `.git`:**

- `objects/`: All file contents and commits (stored as hashes)  
- `refs/heads/`: Branch pointers (e.g., `main`, `dev`)  
- `HEAD`: Points to your current branch  
- `config`: Repository-specific settings  
- `index`: Staging area (tracks what will be committed next)

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- Every Git command will fail with "fatal: not a git repository"

**Verification:**  
ls \-a  
**What to look for:**

- Must see `.git` directory in the output  
- Example output: `.  ..  .git`

git status  
**What to look for:**

- Output: `On branch main` (or `master` on older Git versions)  
- "No commits yet"  
- "nothing to commit"  
- **This proves Git is initialized and working**

---

### Step 1.3: Create Baseline Files

**Commands:**  
cat \> README.md \<\< 'EOF'  
\# Git Team Lab  
This project demonstrates professional Git workflow with remote repositories.  
\#\# Team Workflow  
\- \`main\`: Stable production-ready code  
\- \`dev\`: Integration branch for testing  
\- \`feature/\*\`: Individual feature branches  
\#\# Setup  
See lab instructions for complete setup guide.  
EOF  
cat \> .gitignore \<\< 'EOF'  
\# macOS system files  
.DS\_Store  
.AppleDouble  
.LSOverride  
\# Node.js dependencies  
node\_modules/  
npm-debug.log\*  
\# Environment variables (NEVER commit secrets)  
.env  
.env.local  
.env.\*.local  
\# IDE settings  
.vscode/  
.idea/  
\*.swp  
\*.swo  
\# Build outputs  
dist/  
build/  
\*.log  
EOF  
**What it does:**

- Creates `README.md`: Project documentation (describes purpose and workflow)  
- Creates `.gitignore`: Tells Git which files to ignore (never track)

**Why it's needed:**

- **README.md**: Every professional project needs documentation  
- **.gitignore**: Prevents committing:  
  - System junk (`.DS_Store` on macOS)  
  - Dependencies (can be reinstalled via `package.json`)  
  - Secrets (`.env` files with API keys, passwords)  
  - Build artifacts (generated files)

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- Without `.gitignore`: You'll accidentally commit secrets, huge `node_modules/` folders, or system files  
- **Security risk:** Committed secrets can be stolen even after deletion (Git history persists)  
- **Repository bloat:** Large files make cloning slow

**Verification:**  
cat .gitignore  
**What to look for:**

- Should display the ignore patterns you just created  
- Verify `.env` is listed (critical for security)

ls \-a  
**What to look for:**

- Should see: `.git`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`

---

### Step 1.4: First Commit

**Commands:**  
git add .  
**What it does:**

- Stages all files in the current directory (`.` means "everything here")  
- Moves files from "untracked" to "staged" (ready to commit)  
- Updates the staging area (`.git/index`)

**Why it's needed:**

- Git uses a two-step process: stage → commit  
- Staging lets you choose exactly what goes into each commit  
- Allows partial commits (stage only some changes)

**Verification (before committing):**  
git status  
**What to look for:**

- "Changes to be committed:" section (green text)  
- Should list: `README.md` and `.gitignore`  
- **This proves files are staged**

---

**Command:**  
git commit \-m "Initial commit: Add README and gitignore"  
**What it does:**

- Creates a permanent snapshot (commit) of staged files  
- Stores commit in `.git/objects/` with a unique hash (SHA-1)  
- Moves `main` branch pointer to this new commit  
- `-m`: Specifies commit message inline

**Why it's needed:**

- Commits are the fundamental unit of Git history  
- Without commits, you have no history to push  
- Good commit messages document *why* changes were made

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- No history exists → nothing to push to remote  
- Can't track changes or revert mistakes

**Verification:**  
git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \-n 5  
**What to look for:**

- One commit with your message: "Initial commit: Add README and gitignore"  
- `(HEAD -> main)`: Shows you're on `main` branch and it points to this commit  
- A 7-character hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d`)  
- **This proves the commit exists and `main` points to it**

git status  
**What to look for:**

- "nothing to commit, working tree clean"  
- **This proves all changes are committed (no pending work)**

---

## Part 2: Create Remote Repository & Link Local to Remote

### Step 2.1: Create Remote Repository on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket

**Instructions (choose your platform):**

#### **GitHub:**

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in  
2. Click the `+` icon (top right) → "New repository"  
3. Repository name: `git-team-lab`  
4. **CRITICAL:** Do NOT check "Initialize this repository with a README"  
   - **Why:** Your local repo already has a README and commits  
   - **What breaks:** If remote has commits, first push will fail (divergent histories)  
5. Leave "Add .gitignore" and "Choose a license" as "None"  
6. Click "Create repository"  
7. Copy the repository URL:  
   - **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-team-lab.git`  
   - **SSH:** `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/git-team-lab.git`

**URL Format:**

- Replace `<REMOTE_URL>` in the next steps with your actual URL  
- Example: `https://github.com/johndoe/git-team-lab.git`

---

### Step 2.2: Add Remote to Local Repository

**Command:**  
git remote add origin \<REMOTE\_URL\>  
**Example:**  
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/git-team-lab.git  
**What it does:**

- Registers a remote repository with the nickname "origin"  
- Stores the URL in `.git/config`  
- Does NOT transfer any data (just saves the address)

**Why it's needed:**

- Git needs to know where to push/pull  
- "origin" is the conventional name for the primary remote  
- Without this, `git push` fails with "No configured push destination"

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- `git push` fails: "fatal: No configured push destination"  
- Git has no idea where to send your commits

**Verification:**  
git remote \-v  
**What to look for:**

- Two lines (fetch and push URLs):  
  origin  https://github.com/johndoe/git-team-lab.git (fetch)  
  origin  https://github.com/johndoe/git-team-lab.git (push)  
- **fetch:** URL used for `git pull` and `git fetch`  
- **push:** URL used for `git push`  
- Usually identical unless you have a fork setup  
- **This proves the remote is registered correctly**

---

### Step 2.3: Ensure Correct Default Branch Name

**Command:**  
git branch  
**What to look for:**

- Output: `* main` (preferred modern convention)  
- OR: `* master` (older default on Git \< 2.28)

**If you see `master` and want to rename to `main`:**  
git branch \-M main  
**What it does:**

- `-M`: Force-renames the current branch to "main"  
- Updates `.git/refs/heads/` (deletes `master`, creates `main`)  
- Moves `HEAD` to point to `main`

**Why it's needed:**

- Modern convention: GitHub/GitLab default to `main`  
- Mismatch causes confusion:  
  - Local: `master`  
  - Remote: `main`  
  - Push fails or creates two separate branches

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- First push might create `origin/master` instead of `origin/main`  
- Team expects `main`, but you're working on `master`  
- Requires manual branch reconciliation

**Verification:**  
git branch  
**What to look for:**

- Output: `* main`  
- **This proves you're on the correct branch**

---

### Step 2.4: First Push & Set Upstream Tracking

**Command:**  
git push \-u origin main  
**What it does:**

- `push`: Sends local `main` commits to remote `origin`  
- `-u` (or `--set-upstream`): Creates tracking relationship  
  - Links local `main` to `origin/main`  
  - Enables future `git push` without specifying destination  
- Uploads commit objects, trees, and blobs to remote server

**Why it's needed:**

- Transfers your local commits to the remote (makes them visible on GitHub)  
- Sets up tracking so future pushes are simpler  
- Without `-u`, every push requires `git push origin main` (verbose)

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- Your code stays local (team can't see it)  
- No backup exists (if your machine fails, work is lost)  
- Future `git push` fails: "The current branch main has no upstream branch"

**Expected output:**  
Enumerating objects: 3, done.  
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.  
Delta compression using up to 8 threads  
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.  
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 320 bytes | 320.00 KiB/s, done.  
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0\)  
To https://github.com/johndoe/git-team-lab.git  
 \* \[new branch\]      main \-\> main  
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.  
**Key line:** `Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.`  
---

**Verification:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- Output: `* main a1b2c3d [origin/main] Initial commit: Add README and gitignore`  
- **Breakdown:**  
  - `*`: Current branch  
  - `main`: Branch name  
  - `a1b2c3d`: Latest commit hash  
  - `[origin/main]`: Upstream tracking (local `main` tracks `origin/main`)  
- **This proves upstream tracking is configured**

git branch \-r  
**What to look for:**

- Output: `origin/main`  
- **This lists remote branches Git knows about**  
- Proves `origin/main` exists on the server

git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \-n 5  
**What to look for:**

- Output: `* a1b2c3d (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Initial commit: Add README and gitignore`  
- `(HEAD -> main, origin/main)`: Shows local `main` and `origin/main` point to same commit  
- **This proves local and remote are in sync**

---

### Step 2.5: Verify on Remote Platform

**Instructions:**

1. Open your browser  
2. Navigate to your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/johndoe/git-team-lab`)  
3. Verify:  
   - `README.md` is visible and displays correctly  
   - `.gitignore` exists in file list  
   - Commit message appears: "Initial commit: Add README and gitignore"  
   - Branch dropdown shows `main` (not `master`)

**This is the final proof that push succeeded.**  
---

## Part 3: Professional Sanity Checks (Prevent Future Push Problems)

Before starting any coding work, run this checklist. These checks prevent 90% of common push/pull failures.

### Checkpoint 1: Git Identity Configuration

**Commands:**  
git config \--global user.name  
git config \--global user.email  
**What to look for:**

- `user.name`: Your full name (e.g., "Jane Doe")  
- `user.email`: Your email (e.g., "[jane.doe@example.com](mailto:jane.doe@example.com)")

**What breaks if not set:**

- Commits will have incorrect author information  
- Some Git servers reject commits without proper identity  
- Team can't identify who made changes

**Fix if missing:**  
git config \--global user.name "Your Full Name"  
git config \--global user.email "your.email@example.com"  
---

### Checkpoint 2: Remote Address Correctness

**Command:**  
git remote \-v  
**What to look for:**

- `origin` points to correct repository URL  
- Both fetch and push URLs are present  
- URL matches your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository

**What breaks if incorrect:**

- Push goes to wrong repository (or fails with 403/404)  
- Pull fetches wrong code

**Fix if incorrect:**  
git remote set-url origin \<CORRECT\_URL\>  
---

### Checkpoint 3: Upstream Tracking Exists

**Command:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- Current branch shows `[origin/<branch-name>]` in brackets  
- Example: `* main a1b2c3d [origin/main] Initial commit`

**What breaks if missing:**

- `git push` fails: "The current branch has no upstream branch"  
- Must manually specify destination every time

**Fix if missing:**  
git push \-u origin \<branch-name\>  
---

### Checkpoint 4: Working Tree is Clean

**Command:**  
git status  
**What to look for:**

- "nothing to commit, working tree clean"  
- OR: Clear list of modified/staged files (if you're mid-work)

**What breaks if dirty:**

- Merge conflicts more likely  
- Can't switch branches cleanly  
- Unclear what will be committed

**Fix if dirty (choose one):**  
git add .  
git commit \-m "Describe changes"  
OR  
git stash  
---

### Checkpoint 5: Ahead/Behind Status

**Command:**  
git status \-sb  
**What to look for:**

- `## main...origin/main`: Branches are in sync  
- `## main...origin/main [ahead 1]`: You have 1 unpushed commit  
- `## main...origin/main [behind 2]`: Remote has 2 commits you don't have  
- `## main...origin/main [ahead 1, behind 2]`: Diverged (both have unique commits)

**What it means:**

- **Ahead:** You need to push  
- **Behind:** You need to pull  
- **Diverged:** You need to pull (possibly resolve conflicts), then push

**This is your early warning system for push failures.**  
---

## Part 4: Team Branching Strategy & Execution

### The Strategy: main/dev/feature/\*

**Branch Roles:**

| Branch | Purpose | Who Merges Into It | Stability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `main` | Production-ready code | Release manager (from `dev`) | Highest |
| `dev` | Integration/testing | Developers (from `feature/*`) | Medium |
| `feature/*` | Individual tasks | Developer (commits directly) | Lowest |

**Rules (MUST FOLLOW):**

1. **Never commit directly to `main`** (merge from `dev` only)  
2. **Always branch from `dev`** (not from `main` or other features)  
3. **Always pull `dev` before creating a feature branch** (get latest code)  
4. **Always inspect what will be merged before merging** (prevent surprises)  
5. **Delete feature branches after merging** (keep repo clean)

---

### Step 4.1: Create `dev` Branch and Push It

**Commands:**  
git checkout \-b dev  
**What it does:**

- `-b dev`: Creates a new branch named "dev"  
- `checkout`: Switches to the new branch  
- Copies current commit (from `main`) as starting point

**Why it's needed:**

- Establishes the integration branch  
- Separates unstable work (`dev`) from stable code (`main`)

**Verification:**  
git branch  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
    main  
  \* dev  
- `*` indicates you're on `dev`

---

**Command:**  
git push \-u origin dev  
**What it does:**

- Pushes `dev` branch to remote  
- `-u`: Sets upstream tracking (`dev` → `origin/dev`)

**Verification:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
    main a1b2c3d \[origin/main\] Initial commit  
  \* dev  a1b2c3d \[origin/dev\] Initial commit  
- Both branches track their remote counterparts

git branch \-r  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
  origin/dev  
  origin/main  
- **This proves `dev` exists on remote**

---

### Step 4.2: Create a Feature Branch Correctly

**Commands:**  
git checkout dev  
**What it does:**

- Switches to `dev` branch  
- Updates working directory to match `dev`'s latest commit

**Why it's needed:**

- Feature branches must start from `dev` (not `main` or another feature)  
- Ensures you're building on the integration branch

---

**Command:**  
git pull  
**What it does:**

- Fetches latest commits from `origin/dev`  
- Merges them into your local `dev`  
- Ensures you have the team's latest work

**Why it's needed:**

- **Critical:** Someone else might have merged features while you were away  
- Without this, your feature branch starts from outdated code  
- Leads to merge conflicts later

**What breaks if you skip it:**

- Your feature is based on old code  
- When merging back, you'll conflict with recent changes  
- Wastes time resolving avoidable conflicts

**Expected output (if up to date):**  
Already up to date.  
**OR (if behind):**  
Updating a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  
Fast-forward  
 README.md | 2 \++  
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)  
---

**Command:**  
git checkout \-b feature/add-installation-guide  
**What it does:**

- Creates and switches to `feature/add-installation-guide`  
- Starts from current `dev` commit (because you're on `dev`)

**Naming convention:**

- `feature/`: Prefix for feature branches  
- `add-installation-guide`: Descriptive name (kebab-case)  
- Other prefixes: `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `refactor/`

**Verification:**  
git branch  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
    dev  
  \* feature/add-installation-guide  
    main

git status  
**What to look for:**

- `On branch feature/add-installation-guide`  
- "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

---

### Step 4.3: Make a Change and Commit

**Command:**  
cat \>\> README.md \<\< 'EOF'  
\#\# Installation  
1\. Clone this repository:  
   \`\`\`  
   git clone \<REMOTE\_URL\>  
   cd git-team-lab  
   \`\`\`  
2\. Install dependencies (if applicable):  
   \`\`\`  
   npm install  
   \`\`\`  
3\. Start working on a feature branch:  
   \`\`\`  
   git checkout dev  
   git pull  
   git checkout \-b feature/your-feature-name  
   \`\`\`  
EOF  
\-- **What it does:**

- Appends installation instructions to `README.md`  
- `>>`: Append (don't overwrite)

**Verification:**  
cat README.md  
**What to look for:**

- New "Installation" section at the end

---

**Commands:**  
git add README.md  
git commit \-m "Add installation guide to README"  
**Verification:**  
git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \--all \-n 5  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
  \* b2c3d4e (HEAD \-\> feature/add-installation-guide) Add installation guide to README  
  \* a1b2c3d (origin/main, origin/dev, main, dev) Initial commit: Add README and gitignore  
- `HEAD -> feature/add-installation-guide`: You're on the feature branch  
- Feature branch is 1 commit ahead of `dev`

---

### Step 4.4: Push Feature Branch

**Command:**  
git push \-u origin feature/add-installation-guide  
**What it does:**

- Pushes feature branch to remote  
- Sets upstream tracking

**Why it's needed:**

- Backs up your work  
- Allows team to see your progress  
- Required for pull requests (GitHub/GitLab workflow)

**Verification:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
  \* feature/add-installation-guide b2c3d4e \[origin/feature/add-installation-guide\] Add installation guide

git branch \-r  
**What to look for:**

- Output includes: `origin/feature/add-installation-guide`

---

### Step 4.5: Merge Feature → Dev Safely

**Step 4.5.1: Switch to `dev` and Pull Latest**  
**Commands:**  
git checkout dev  
git pull  
**What it does:**

- Switches to `dev`  
- Fetches and merges latest changes from `origin/dev`

**Why it's needed:**

- **Critical:** Ensures you're merging into the latest `dev`  
- Someone might have merged another feature while you worked  
- Without this, you might overwrite their work

**Expected output:**  
Already up to date.  
---

**Step 4.5.2: Inspect What Will Be Merged**  
**Command:**  
git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \--all \-n 20  
**What to look for:**

- Visual graph showing branch divergence  
- Example:  
  \* b2c3d4e (origin/feature/add-installation-guide, feature/add-installation-guide) Add installation guide  
  \* a1b2c3d (HEAD \-\> dev, origin/main, origin/dev, main) Initial commit  
- Shows `feature/add-installation-guide` is 1 commit ahead of `dev`

---

**Command:**  
git diff dev..feature/add-installation-guide  
**What it does:**

- Shows exact line-by-line changes between `dev` and the feature branch  
- `..`: Compares two branches

**What to look for:**

- Green lines (`+`): Additions  
- Red lines (`-`): Deletions  
- Should match your intended changes  
- **If you see unexpected changes, STOP and investigate**

**Why this inspection is critical:**

- Prevents accidental merges of wrong code  
- Catches mistakes before they enter `dev`  
- Professional teams ALWAYS review before merging

---

**Step 4.5.3: Merge**  
**Command:**  
git merge feature/add-installation-guide  
**What it does:**

- Merges feature branch into `dev`  
- Creates a merge commit (or fast-forward if possible)  
- Updates `dev` pointer to include feature commits

**Expected output (fast-forward):**  
Updating a1b2c3d..b2c3d4e  
Fast-forward  
 README.md | 15 \+++++++++++++++

**Step 4.5.4: Verify Merge Success**  
**Commands:**  
git status  
**What to look for:**

- "On branch dev"  
- "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/dev' by 1 commit"  
- "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \--all \-n 10  
**What to look for:**

- `dev` and `feature/add-installation-guide` point to same commit  
- Example:  
  \* b2c3d4e (HEAD \-\> dev, origin/feature/add-installation-guide, feature/add-installation-guide) Add installation guide  
  \* a1b2c3d (origin/main, origin/dev, main) Initial commit

---

**Step 4.5.5: Push `dev`**  
**Command:**  
git push  
**What it does:**

- Pushes local `dev` to `origin/dev`  
- No need for `-u` (tracking already set)

**Verification:**  
git status \-sb  
**What to look for:**

- `## dev...origin/dev`  
- No `[ahead]` or `[behind]` (in sync)

---

### Step 4.6: Merge Dev → Main Safely (Release Step)

**Step 4.6.1: Switch to `main` and Pull**  
**Commands:**  
git checkout main  
git pull  
**What it does:**

- Switches to `main`  
- Ensures you have latest production code

---

**Step 4.6.2: Inspect Diff**  
**Command:**  
git diff main..dev  
**What to look for:**

- All changes accumulated in `dev` since last release  
- Should include your installation guide changes  
- **Review carefully—this is going to production**

---

**Step 4.6.3: Merge**  
**Command:**  
git merge dev  
**Expected output:**  
Updating a1b2c3d..b2c3d4e  
Fast-forward

**Step 4.6.4: Push `main`**  
**Command:**  
git push  
**Verification:**  
git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \--all \-n 10  
**What to look for:**

- Output:  
  \* b2c3d4e (HEAD \-\> main, origin/main, origin/dev, dev, origin/feature/add-installation-guide, feature/add-installation-guide) Add installation guide  
  \* a1b2c3d Initial commit  
- `main`, `origin/main`, `dev`, and `origin/dev` all point to same commit  
- **This proves release is complete**

---

### Step 4.7: Clean Up Feature Branch (Optional but Recommended)

**Commands:**  
git branch \-d feature/add-installation-guide  
git push origin \--delete feature/add-installation-guide  
**What it does:**

- `-d`: Deletes local feature branch (safe delete—only works if merged)  
- `--delete`: Deletes remote feature branch

**Why it's needed:**

- Keeps branch list clean  
- Prevents confusion (feature is done)  
- Professional teams delete merged branches

---

## Part 5: Debugging & "Never Have Push Surprises" Checklist

### When You Think You Pushed But Nothing Happened

Run these commands in order. Each reveals a piece of the puzzle.

#### Command 1: Where Am I?

git branch  
**What it tells you:**

- Which branch you're currently on (`*` marker)  
- All local branches

**Common mistake:**

- You think you're on `main`, but you're on `feature/xyz`  
- Push succeeded, but to the wrong branch

---

#### Command 2: Where Does This Branch Push To?

git remote \-v  
**What it tells you:**

- Remote URL (is it correct?)  
- Fetch vs push URLs

**Common mistake:**

- Remote URL is wrong (typo, wrong repo)  
- Pushing to your fork instead of team repo

---

#### Command 3: Is Upstream Tracking Set?

git branch \-vv  
**What it tells you:**

- `[origin/branch-name]`: Tracking is set  
- No brackets: **No tracking** (push will fail)

**Common mistake:**

- First push without `-u` flag  
- Branch exists locally but not remotely

---

#### Command 4: Are There Uncommitted Changes?

git status  
**What it tells you:**

- Modified files (red): Not staged  
- Staged files (green): Ready to commit  
- "nothing to commit": All changes committed

**Common mistake:**

- You edited files but didn't commit  
- Push succeeded, but changes aren't in the commit

---

#### Command 5: What's the Commit History?

git log \--oneline \--decorate \-n 10  
**What it tells you:**

- Recent commits  
- Where `HEAD`, local branches, and remote branches point

**Common mistake:**

- You committed to wrong branch  
- Remote is ahead (you're behind)

---

#### Command 6: Am I Ahead or Behind?

git status \-sb  
**What it tells you:**

- `[ahead 2]`: You have 2 unpushed commits  
- `[behind 3]`: Remote has 3 commits you don't have  
- `[ahead 1, behind 2]`: Diverged

**Common mistake:**

- You're behind → push fails (non-fast-forward)  
- Need to pull first

---

## Part 6: Common Failures & Professional Fixes

### Failure 1: "fatal: No configured push destination"

**Full error:**  
fatal: The current branch feature/xyz has no upstream branch.  
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use  
    git push \--set-upstream origin feature/xyz  
**Cause:**

- You created a branch locally but never pushed it  
- No upstream tracking configured

**Diagnosis:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- Current branch has no `[origin/...]` in brackets

**Fix:**  
git push \-u origin \<branch-name\>  
**Example:**  
git push \-u origin feature/xyz  
**What it does:**

- Pushes branch to remote  
- Sets upstream tracking for future pushes

**Verification:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- `[origin/feature/xyz]` now appears

---

### Failure 2: "rejected (non-fast-forward)"

**Full error:**  
To https://github.com/user/repo.git  
 \! \[rejected\]        main \-\> main (non-fast-forward)  
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'  
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind  
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.  
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.  
**Cause:**

- Remote has commits you don't have  
- Your local branch is behind  
- Git refuses to overwrite remote commits

**Diagnosis:**  
git status \-sb  
**What to look for:**

- `[behind X]` or `[ahead Y, behind Z]`

**Fix (Option 1: Merge):**  
git pull  
git push  
**What it does:**

- `git pull`: Fetches remote commits and merges them  
- Creates a merge commit  
- `git push`: Pushes the merged result

**Fix (Option 2: Rebase \- Cleaner History):**  
git pull \--rebase  
git push  
**What it does:**

- `--rebase`: Fetches remote commits and replays your commits on top  
- Avoids merge commit (linear history)  
- **Preferred for feature branches**

**Rebase vs Merge (High-Level):**

- **Merge:** Preserves exact history (shows when branches diverged)  
- **Rebase:** Rewrites history (makes it look like you started from latest)  
- **Rule:** Use rebase for local branches, merge for shared branches

**Verification:**  
git status \-sb  
**What to look for:**

- No `[behind]` indicator  
- `[ahead X]` if you have new commits

---

### Failure 3: "I Don't See My Code on GitHub"

**Symptoms:**

- Push succeeded (no errors)  
- Code not visible on GitHub/GitLab

**Diagnosis Steps:**  
**Step 1: Which branch did you push?**  
git branch  
**What to look for:**

- `*` shows current branch  
- Did you push a different branch than you intended?

---

**Step 2: Which remote branches exist?**  
git branch \-r  
**What to look for:**

- List of `origin/*` branches  
- Is your branch in the list?

**Example:**  
origin/dev  
origin/feature/xyz  
origin/main  
---

**Step 3: Where did the push go?**  
git remote \-v  
**What to look for:**

- Is the URL correct?  
- Did you push to a fork instead of the main repo?

---

**Step 4: Check GitHub/GitLab branch dropdown**

- Go to repository on web  
- Click branch dropdown (usually shows "main" by default)  
- Look for your branch name  
- **If found:** Code is there, just not on `main`

---

**Common causes:**

1. **Pushed to feature branch, looking at `main`**  
   - Fix: Switch branch on GitHub UI  
2. **Pushed to wrong remote**  
   - Fix: `git remote -v`, correct URL, push again  
3. **Pushed to fork instead of upstream**  
   - Fix: Add correct remote, push there

## Part 7: Final Practical Test / Submission

### Proof Pack: Terminal Outputs

Run these commands and save the output. This proves your repository is correctly configured.

#### Proof 1: Repository Structure

**Command:**  
ls \-a  
**What to look for:**

- `.git` directory (proves Git is initialized)  
- `README.md` (project documentation)  
- `.gitignore` (ignore rules)

---

**Command:**  
git status  
**What to look for:**

- "On branch \[branch-name\]"  
- "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/\[branch-name\]'"  
- "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

**What it proves:**

- Repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)  
- Branch is tracked and synced with remote

---

#### Proof 2: Remote Configuration

**Command:**  
git remote \-v  
**What to look for:**

- `origin` with correct GitHub/GitLab URL  
- Both fetch and push URLs present

**What it proves:**

- Remote is configured  
- Push/pull destination is correct

---

#### Proof 3: Branch Tracking

**Command:**  
git branch \-vv  
**What to look for:**

- Each branch shows `[origin/branch-name]` in brackets  
- Example:  
  \* dev  b2c3d4e \[origin/dev\] Add installation guide  
    main a1b2c3d \[origin/main\] Initial commit

**What it proves:**

- Upstream tracking is configured  
- Simple `git push` will work

---

#### Proof 4: Remote Branches

**Command:**  
git branch \-r  
**What to look for:**

- List of `origin/*` branches  
- Should include at least: `origin/main`, `origin/dev`

**What it proves:**

- Branches exist on remote server  
- Push succeeded

---

#### Proof 5: Commit History & Branch Graph

**Command:**  
git log \--oneline \--decorate \--graph \--all \-n 30  
**What to look for:**

- Graph showing branch relationships  
- Commits with proper messages  
- Branch pointers (`HEAD`, `main`, `origin/main`, etc.)

**Example output:**  
\* b2c3d4e (HEAD \-\> main, origin/main, origin/dev, dev) Add installation guide  
\* a1b2c3d (origin/feature/add-installation-guide) Initial commit: Add README and gitignore  
**What it proves:**

- Commit history is correct  
- Branches are properly merged  
- Local and remote are in sync

---

### Submission Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] All commands in Proof Pack run without errors  
- [ ] `git remote -v` shows correct repository URL  
- [ ] `git branch -vv` shows upstream tracking for all branches  
- [ ] `git status` shows "working tree clean"  
- [ ] Repository is visible on GitHub/GitLab with all commits  
- [ ] `main` and `dev` branches exist on remote  
- [ ] At least one feature branch was created, merged, and deleted

**Optional:** Take screenshots of:

1. GitHub repository page showing branches  
2. Terminal output of `git log --graph --all`  
3. GitHub network graph (Insights → Network)

---

## Summary: Key Takeaways

### Mental Model

- **Local repo** (.git folder) is independent from **remote repo** (GitHub)  
- **Upstream tracking** links local branches to remote branches  
- **Always verify** before assuming success

### Critical Commands

- `git remote -v`: Check remote URL  
- `git branch -vv`: Check upstream tracking  
- `git status -sb`: Check ahead/behind status  
- `git log --graph --all`: Visualize branch history

### Workflow Rules

1. Always pull before creating feature branches  
2. Always inspect before merging (`git diff`, `git log`)  
3. Never commit directly to `main`  
4. Always verify push succeeded (`git branch -r`)

### Debugging Approach

1. Run diagnostic commands (don't guess)  
2. Read error messages carefully  
3. Check one thing at a time  
4. Verify fix worked before continuing

---

## Next Steps

**Practice this workflow:**

1. Create 3 more feature branches  
2. Make different changes in each  
3. Merge them one by one into `dev`  
4. Release `dev` to `main`  
5. Practice resolving a merge conflict (create one intentionally)

**Advanced topics to explore:**

- Pull requests (GitHub/GitLab UI workflow)  
- Rebasing vs merging strategies  
- Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)  
- Resolving merge conflicts  
- Cherry-picking commits  
- Interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`)

- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (free, comprehensive)  
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/)  
- [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/)
